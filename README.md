# Iris_code

This repository is a space to put machine learning data and code for the Iris project

In the Iris_Project_Exam_Basic, The Iris Flower dataset was used to evaluate two machine learning algorythms: LogisticRegression and Support Vector Classification. Even if they are used more often for binnary classification they have the capability of doing multiclass classification under certain conditions (with certain parameters, or models such as one versus one and one versus rest, ...).
After splitting the dataset into trainning dataset and test dataset, the models were trained using K-fold Cross-Validation. Both models give good results with an accuracy in recognizing the right class better than 96%.

In the Iris_Project_Advanced_v1_2, the same Iris Flower dataset was used to train 3 more complex models : Decision Tree , Random Forest and a simple Neural Network. The tuning of such model seems to be much complex and the fitting more resource and time consuming than for Logistic Regression without adding better results.
These results are conforting in the fact that for such regrassion data sets / problem complex neural network modeling is unnecessary.
