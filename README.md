# Iris_code

This repository is a space to put machine learning data and code for the Iris project

The Iris Flower dataset was used to evaluate two machine learning algorythms: LogisticRegression and Support Vector Classification. Even if they are used more often for binnary classification they have the capability of doing multiclass classification under certain conditions (with certain parameters, or models such as one versus all, ...).
After splitting the dataset into trainning dataset and test dataset, the models were trained using K-fold Cross-Validation. Both models give good results with an accuracy in recognizing the right class better than 96%.
